I have experienced something I choose to call God because it closely resembles parts of descriptions made of God by scholars and mystics of various religions.

I don't pretend to know who - or rather what - God is, but I have on occasion felt something that I can only translate by this name.

To me God is a very personal experience - of love, compassion, unity - but has little to do with many religious precepts and traditions which are what, I think, many atheist criticize. I appreciate religion as a space to discuss this god experience (and I also think rituals and community can be good things) but still very much dislike when religious organisations try to tell people what they should do.

I don't think "believing in god" is the right way to frame the question. You may believe that the bible or another book come from god, but it is distinct to me, and necessarily comes after having faith. You have faith when you feel God.
