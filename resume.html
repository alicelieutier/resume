        <h1>Spoken Languages</h1>
            <p><b>French</b> is my native language.</p>
            <p>I pushed myself to read the Harry Potter books in <b>English</b> when I was 13, and got subsequently accepted at international high school where I became fluent. I have been living in London since 2012.</p>
            <p>I did a one-year exchange in Argentina during my studies, allowing me to read, write and speak <b>Spanish</b> fluently.</p>
            <p>My second language in school was <b>German</b> and I can read books and have broken conversations.</p>
            <p>Over the years, I also taught myself some <b>Turkish</b> and <b>Hebrew</b> and studied <b>Mandarin Chinese</b>.</p>
